Howdy! I answer to many names: SUNJIR0, A9C-388, Hilary, 卡道夫, but most know me as Kadallah. I am an artist and researcher, primarily interested in community technology. I make all kinds of art, from photography and music, to virtual reality experiences and social art practice, but usually my work either incorporates or comments on technology. As a writer, my work spans [[poetry\|#poetry]], creative non-fiction, and more academic prose. I am Pan-African by birth, and have lived around the world. These inherited and lived experiences shape my worldview.

This portal is a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), a collection of thoughts, musings, and ideas in various stages of completion. For a more standard view of my portfolio, feel free to click here.
