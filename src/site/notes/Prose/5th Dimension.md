Afrofuturism has evolved from its earlier 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th dimensional phases into a new era. An era defined by interconnectivity, explorations of the multiverse, and even more revolutionary politics. New terminology is needed in order to describe this expanded field birthed by and made possible through Afrofuturism that acknowledges this lineage without confining all alternative Black aesthetics and philosophies to this fairly limited term.

In 1991, a mortal possessed by the spirit of capital declared the victory of liberalism and capitalism over the “savage other.” He called it “the end of history.” All inferior ideologies would wilt and perish as we marched a yellow brick road to golden arches just this side of a forever setting sun.

**And** in that light that fluctuates between rose gold and blood red, we will always remember, we can never forget what one man repeated that another originally had said, how “it’s easier to imagine the death of the earth than capitalism’s end.”

**And** these things are both mostly true. With mass sousveillance documenting your every move and both everyone and no one watching every little nothing that you do, each moment itself an archive of times that have and will forever exist in the past, but were made post-truth. Through this marriage of authoritatively performed morality and an anthropomorphized conservative war chest, a new hegemon has been born: neoliberalism.

**And** just ask the people on the south side of the third world from your sun how many worlds capital had not just outlived, but executed; not just executed, but consumed whole, eaten alive. What is another tower falling, they may reply, when the rubble has not yet settled and the dust of the last empire still line our lungs, whose lies still coat our tongues?

**And** these things are also false too. As the NRx attempts to resurrect ancient rituals of slavery and serfdom, of big men with big guns, and don’t even ask about the size of their sticks. Reality TV presidents preserving promises of persecution for future textbooks to censor and distort. The struggle is not in a hermetically sealed past, the ticker tape clicks on, even if its output is locked behind emotionally manipulative paywalls.

**And** capitalism has ended. Just with the kind of terrible twist that promised an even shittier sequel to an already bloated franchise. One we should have, but refused to see coming. Vectoralism has delivered on the promise of its predecessor: even more guns and explosions! Even more conveniently happy endings for our reality’s protagonists! Even more bleeding edge tech to court yesterday’s nerds, today’s bosses! More glitz! More glam! More amazing performances from the players, I mean politicians on screen! But what’s more? Now we have memes. Now we have new means to abstract capital value from that which was previously real. Swiping on strangers while practicing daily self love and double touching the right children’s corpses to match the emojis in our seasonally updated IDs. Our attention has been captured.

**And** that is the first lesson here in the 5th Dimension. It is not just possible, but more common than not for multiple truths to coexist in the same realm.
