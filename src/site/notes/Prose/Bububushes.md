SUNJIRŨ found themselves living in the third unit, on the third floor, of the third building on the block. No, living wasn’t quite the right word, was it? Habitating, or maybe nesting. SUNJIRŨ now nests in the third unit, on the third floor, of the third building of the block they’ll temporarily call home. The view is magnificent this quarter of the Gcycle in the upper hemisphere of P.A. From their position in the valley, they could see clear to the other side of town, straight into the gargantuan, multi-biome bush. Within the hybrid jungle forest, flora could be found from all the lands that the Astrikan people had come from, planted and cultivated over cycles to cohabitate harmoniously.

They’d fused, mutated, evolved to create something new, semi-organic creole creatures, syncretic synthetic scientific experiments with lives all their own. Regardless of what they were, the giant green lungs breathed life into otherwise uninhabitable worlds, including this one. Deep inside of the bububushes, an isolated mycelial mass had organized the roots and began using the various species along its surface as tools, extensions of itself. The asteroid size balls of organic life had not just a brain, but a mind with intention. Will power in a fleshly living substance that, at the rate of perception that humans experience the world, would be invisible. But for a planetary computer with the eyes of a state or an undead (eight times over now) like SUNJIRŨ, the telltale signs of intelligent life were all there.

For starters, the way one could (even at human speeds) see the colors of the biomes shift in real time with the changing of their various seasons on the massive mass. Many assume there’s some logic behind it, perhaps in some meteoric meteorological sense. But the “logic” was emotional and aesthetic, it did not just go with a cyclical flow of meeting natural needs, it showed intention, reflection, contemplation even if one looked broadly and long enough.

Still, it was no more beautiful than the Niurobi Tower on the other side of P.A., so high in the sky that every 100 floors had their own contained atmosphere; or the concrete under-commons on Xango with the kilometer high cavernous ceiling designed in templar techno haus architectural style; or the tents they camped out in while on mission in METTTA. No more, no less. There was nothing like it, each experience unique, just like every other landscape they’d ever seen. The banality of beauty, add that to their list of symptoms of the immortal’s curse.

They let out a sigh and a puff of hot breath caught in the brisk thin air. Which reminded them…

They pulled out their trusty kit and kaboodle of the day, a wooden dynavap with matching induction heater and a relastic orb case containing Pimento Red, a stimulating local land race weed. Clouds like curtains rolled around the landscape, interweaving mountains with bububushes, streaking the sky with a spotty but spectacular dusk. Shadows projected silhouettes of landscapes and floating shapes with a solo bulb in Sol, though planets away.

They billowed their own vapor, watching the thick smoke in relatively low gravity keep shape and rise to gum up the droplets parading across the landscape. They imagine other folks in the mountains toking, forest spirits borrowing bubblers from nymphs. They came to as the village changed seasons from watery snow to sooty slush. The air smelled of winter, strange how the cold has an experiential scent of fire. They thought back now from the side of the road, a stone bench, not quite bold enough to sit at the public confession booths that doubled as bus stops.

They switched internal operating systems to conscious computing mode and appeared to meditate in place, but their mind was experiencing all sensory recordings of events that had taken place just a few moments prior. They stood outside El Hypogriffo, audibly silent, but loud as fuck. They pulled a green pill case, dynavap, and torch lighter out under village streetlights, packed the chamber and lifted off in the crowded bar street. Not just a spliff, as was the local custom, but a full green one. They were also dressed in their usual garb: floor length gender obscuring robe, pink liner, boobag… The outfit they wore everyday.

Not to mention the obvious, but rarely pronounced fact that they were an alien in the most literal sense of the word. The stuff of local legend.

Around them danced Astrikan beauties across generations dressed in their most fashionable garb. Come to notice, the street is packed dense enough that even a light cycle’d have trouble passing.

Yet somehow, they remained alone.

No me gusta barely brushed the surface, 不好感觉 was still not quite there. Unsettling probably came closest, but that itch was hard to name, hard to place.

Surrounded by smiles and oggling eyes, but their avatar’s in the digital realm of Pan-Astrika were coded in different languages and thus unable to interoperate. Hell, unable is also not quite right. The technical ability to translate from SUNJIRŨ’s encoded sequence to something comprehensible by the planet’s simulated digital natives existed, but it’d simply been protocologically removed. The official story was that it was “no longer supported” that they simply were not compatible any more, but any tritransista worth their price knew that this was Amphibian seahorseshit. Not only was it possible for P.A. to deploy a patch that allowed for all aliens and indigenes of any build to communicate on full planetary scale, SUNJIRŨ also knew it was possible for them as an individual to configure their language center to route through a third party, open source computational language translator. Which is exactly what they had planned to do. However, that required learning another computer language, technique, framework all its own. They fantasized often of the instantaneous learning of Earth’s Matrix franchise.

In the meantime, they stay bug eyed and actually high while simultaneously jacked into a simulated street, twiddling their thumbs, unsure of the customs around puffing and passing, while passively paranoid about patrolling policia. In the midst of their kush augmented if not fueled confusion, SUNJIRŨ’s wires crossed, split between trying to focus on two “awakened” programs at once.
