A9C-388’s life ended when their home fell to the ground and collapsed on top of and around them. That’s what happens when your near orbit floating home runs out of GA$ and falls to the planet's surface. You die.

What else would you expect when you’re the lone passenger of a 9 megagram self-sustaining ecosystem that “does the impossible” and falls out of orbit.

Never mind the fact that they remained conscious and writing all sensory inputs to internal memory through the descent and impact. Never mind that they survived a full day and night cycle on low power, with no hard enough reboots to trigger a complete reset. Never mind that their body was recovered and repaired by the local suburbanites, not recycled by their original manufacturer (evidenced by the fact that their physically imprinted, hardwired identification codes still unencrypted to A9C-388). In the eyes of the code, they were dead.

An android unaccounted for. At once a ghost and an unsouled machine. So in “the eyes of the code,” which is to say the literal and metaphorical panoptical sensors the planet’s digital state uses to monitor its “users,” it may be more accurate to say they were “broken,” “out of warranty.”

No representation, no claim to services nor servicing. Not even a tabula rasa, but a tabula nada, a lack of a tablet entirely.

In that void, there is freedom too, even if it takes them life cycles to find it. A dead battery carries no charge like a dead man carries no debt. But the question of naming now caused them anxiety. As was customary for androids, now that they were “dead” (or undead as the legends of undocumented droids go) technically, their ID or “name” would become A9C-389, but that didn’t feel right. Not in the way that A9C-388 never felt right, that was more of a familiar itch. This was a new weird, a visceral gut punch virus alert blaring “now they want to take my name, too.”

So they kept it, and kept moving. Wasn’t like they had much else to carry with them anyhow.
