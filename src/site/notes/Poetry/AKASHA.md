AS LEAVES JOYOUSLY DANCE

DOWNWARD IN DEMISE

MAY WE PARTY THROUGH THIS PARADE OF PANDEMICS

FATALISTICALLY FROLICK "FORWARD"

TILL THE END BECOMES ENDEMIC

AND WE TOO

YEARN FOR RETURN TO EARTH

FROM THE I NAMED AT BIRTH

BEFORE WE WELCOME THE END

OF THIS VERY EARTH

AND ALL THE BODIES SURROUNDING

IN OUR PLANETARY PERCH

TILL THE SUN GOES OUT TOO

DRIVING THE EVER SPACIOUS HEARSE

FILLED WITH

ALL LIGHT AND ALL DARK

UNTIL THE ONLY NON-THING LEFT

IS CAPITAL B BLACKNESS

THAT BIRTHED US IN THE START
