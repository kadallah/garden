THE WHEEL DOESN'T SPIN TO SPITE THE GROUND

YET HERE WE FOREVER FIGHT AGAINST

ANTI-POST-DECONSTRUCTING

THE PROLI-PRE-MODERNISTS' SINS

THIS FOR THAT

BINARY SPATS

FOR

DREAMSCAPES PRE-IMAGINED

WHILE

SILENCE SCREAMS OF

UNBOUGHT OUT MEANS

AND DYSTOPIAS AS OF YET UNFATHOMED

THE OBFUSCATED PROTAGONIST SPEAKS OF

LANDS WARRIOR MONKS NEVER STOPPED SEEKING

AND FIGHT AND FOUGHT FOR WITHOUT EVER SCORE KEEPING

‘TIL ALL GHOSTS ROAMED HUNGRY

NEVER REACHING CONSUMPTION PEAKS

ON LAND ALL CONSUMED

BUT WHAT OF OUR WORLD POST-DROWNING

OR ENTRENCHED STRETCHES OF THIS GLOBE SO FAR DOWN WE

HAVE YET TO STRIVE TO SEE OURSELVES

STEALING FROM THEIR SUBMERGED SHORES

NOW ENTER THE BILLIONAIRE

MAYBE BABY’S BLUE IN ORIGIN

MAYBE BABY’S IN THEIR PRIME

CLUTCHING IN THEIR CLAW A CLAIM

“HERE BE THE TREASURE ON MY HAND DRAWN MAP

SEE THE SEA FLOOR

DRAGONS AND ALL”

BELOW CRESTS CRASHIN

BEAUTY LIKE NEVER BEFORE PERCEIVED BY

UNIMPLODED STEREOSCOPES

PHOTOSENSITIVE RETINAL GANGLION CELLS

AND SCENTS AND SMELLS

HUMAN NOSES DON’T HAVE ROADS IN THEIR BRAINS FOR

WHICH IS TO SAY

SOMETHING MADE

OVER WHICH THEY HAVE NO RIGHTFUL CLAIM TOWARD

“BUT HOW OFTEN HAS THAT STOPPED THEM BEFORE?”

ASK SHAPESHIFTING JUJU

LIVING AURORA BORE-AURAS

COHABITATING WITH PSILOCYBIN ANCESTORS THAT

MYCELIED THE SEA FLORA

HOW OFTEN HAS THAT STOPPED THEM

REPEAT GILLS GULPING GRAMMER

WITHOUT A TRANSLATOR AROUND

THAT RESIDE IN INTERSPECIES CITIES

THAT DON'T BEG FOR MORE AND MORE AND MORE...

NOW, ALL THE FISH IN THE SEA SPEAK

JUST NOT TO YOU OR THE ROYAL WE

AND HUGH SWEARS

THIS TIME, AIN'T GOT NOTHIN' TO DO WIT ME,

SEE, FOUR OUT OF FIVE SCIENTISTS WITH FLESH LIKE ME AGREE

MESSAGES RECEIVED HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH

MUDDIED WATERS

AND THOUGH THEY DISGUISE THEIR DRONES

AS BIOLOGICALLY COMPATIBLE CLONES

FISH HAVE A SENSE FOR THE FISHY, UNIRONICALLY

STILL "WE" "SEE"

-ILLION YEAR OLD JELLY

AND LIGHT UP GOO

EXPERIMENTS BROILING FOR EONS IN THE STEW

FLOWING GUSHERS MERE KELVIN DEGREES

FLOATING PUBLIC HOUSES

NO DEFENSIVELY LANDSCAPED STREETS

THEIR LANGUAGES ARE CULTURAL AND COMPLEX

CANTS AND CREOLES RESPECTED WITH THE REST

WITH SYNERGY THAT CAN'T BE BELIEVED

AND THE SOUP ITSELF SPEAKS

TONES BUBBLING UP FROM THE DEEP

THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS EXPERIENCED

ON A LEVEL BEYOND SPECIES

INDIVIDUAL ORGANISMS RETURN TO ORGAN TISSUE

WHILE WE PUSH THE ISSUE JUST TO BREAK THE TREATISE

(THEY WONDER IF THAT'S WHAT AN ITCH IS

AND IF THEY'RE AN IT SITCH

NOW "IT'S" AN AGENDA ITEM AT A FUTURE TOWN HALL)

PRAY RECALL, THEY ASK,

WHOSE TURF IS THE SURF?

QUESTION

WHO DIED THE OCEAN BLUER THAN A SMURF

PUT A SPECIES IN THE HEARSE

TOOK OUT MILLIONS MORE WITHOUT LEAVING REVERSE

ON THE WAY TO PURCHASE FROZEN STICKS TO STORE

IN THE HOT NEW MICROWAVABLE PURSE

QUESTIONS

WHO COLONIZED SUNSHINE THE SIZE OF FRANCE

GENTRIFIED NOW WHITE REEFS

BLEACHED ORGANS RED HANDS

WHO CAUGHT MONSTERS IN THEIR LEASH

SKEWERED HEARTS 2 CENTS A PIECE

JACK UP THE PRICE IF THERE’S

NO NET IN THE TEETH

NO BLOOD IN YOUR SHIT

NO SHIT IN YOUR MEAT

WHO KILLED THEIR BROTHER

ABOARD A FLOATING PRISON OUTSIDE THEIR OWN HOME

PUSHED OVERBOARD TO BLOAT

INTERRUPTED CRIES FOR HELP

WITH A FALSE HAND

AND A PREPLANNED SPEECH TO BOAST

NOW, HAM LIVES IN THE DEPTHS BESIDES THEM

THE OSTRACIZED AND OCTOPIZED MAN

ENLIVENED BY DIFFERENT SIZES OF

SHAPESHIFTING JUJU

AURORA BORE-AURA

ECOSYSTEMIC DREAMEMORIES

BREAKING NEWS ON YOUR SHORES CUZ

HIDDEN IN A GARDEN OF SILICON

WHERE MEN COST RUM AND WOMEN ALUMINUM

A TOWER TEETERS

THERE, THE GHOSTS KNOW NO SATIATION

WHERE HUNGER MEETS EMACIATION

THE CROWD JEERS AND

A STUDIO LOT APPEARS,

RENTED THROUGH AN APP

ANALYTICS ALL TRACKED

AND IT'S EVERYTHING WE FEARED

BACK WHEN WE FEARED

A SPACE BELOW

AS OF YET UNKNOWN

TO THOSE WHO LOOK DOWN AIR BREATHING NOSES

BUT NETWORKS ADRIFT

FLOATING SCHOOLS BELOW SHIPS

WITH NO VOCABULARY FOR TIME OR TO DEFINE FOES

A BRAIN OF AUTONOMOUS NEURONS

FLOATING IN BLACKNESS ONLY RIVALED BY SPACE

COMMUNICATE

AND THE SOUP ITSELF SPEAKS

COMES FROM THE DEEP

AS THE SOUP ITSELF SPEAKS

COMING FROM THE DEEP

META METICULOUSLY SWINGING TO SLAY THE BEAST

METTTATICIANS LINKED UP WITH MAMI WATA

AN ORISHA SHIMMIES OASIS ACROSS THE SAHARA

FROM NAM LOLWE TO BOSOMTWE

LEAVING CRATERS IN HER WAKE

BEFORE DEPARTING TO BIRTH

WHOLE PLANETS ENCASED IN ICE

MYTHOCRACIES DISTILLING HISTORIES

FROM A FAR OFF

PLACE IN SPACE

BUT CAN WE BUY TIME FOR

A PLANETARY CONSCIOUSNESS

IN A MARBLE NEAR OUR SOL

OR A PROTOTYPE AT LEAST

FOR AN INTERSPECIES SOUL

SOMETHINGS WRIGGLE TO THE SURFACE

WITH A TENDENCY TO FLOAT

BUT A HANKERING TO BOIL

AND

(FOR SOME REASON)

TO POISON THE SOIL

HAVING ALREADY FORGOTTEN

ALL THE KINGDOMS OF MOLES

WHO WENT OUT ON RECON ONE DAY

AND THE NEXT DIVIDED THE SPOILS

NOW,

PRESSURIZED DEPTHS ARE GETTING HOTTER

IMAGINED HELLS MADE REAL

NOW,

LESS SKELETON BONES SKIM THE WATER

BUT WHO KNOWS HOW LONG AGO WE BROKE THE SEAL

QUESTION

WHO KNOWS
