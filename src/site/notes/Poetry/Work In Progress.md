Long ago, a spider crawled into the ear of a great technocrat while they slept and asked "what do you think exists on the other side of that great blue void?" 

In that time-space, the ruler controlled a vast empire at the edge of the known world, while, unbeknownst to them (or the four horses of the north) a great turtle covered in colorful people floated, content in the shadows on the other side of the globe.

The ruler built ship after ship until satisfied with the many designs, and then boarded their own fleet with sights set on the unseen horizon, saying "I will only return if I run out of food or water."

Spider hitched a ride, and smiled throughout. When they arrived, they were delighted to find peaceful people woven together despite their difference, big and small. They traded kente for quilt, while spider scurried across the turtle's back in search of their grandmother, the weaver of this realm. And for many seasons, they all lived content.

Until one day, hungry ghosts followed the scent of jollof rice down the coast and across the ocean to trade it for paella, pain, and palava. By that point, the mansa was too old for the long trek home, so they put their baby on a plane, strapped a three to their name... and prayed.

BUT WAIT… IN THAT CASE

WHO AM i?

JUST THE NEXT BODY IN A LONG LINE?

JUST MY PARENTS PARENTS PARENTS DREAM FOR A BETTER LIFE?

JUST THE LATEST INCARNATION WITH A NEW STAR SIGN?

CUZ i’M TRYING MY HARDEST TO GET IT ALL RIGHT THIS TIME

AND THAT SOUNDS LIKE THAT MAKES ME

JUST AN UNFINISHED LINE

AN UNCOUPLED RHYME

SOME MISMATCHED METER WITH A SCHEME OUT OF TIME

BUT WHO SAYS ITS MORE MORAL TO COME FROM EARTH PRIME

WHO SAYS THIS BODY IS EVEN MINE

Y’KNOW THERE’S NO i IN TEAM, NO ME IN i & i

SO WHOSE TO FIGHT THE GHOST IN THIS MACHINE

WHEN THIS FLESH FITS FINE

WHEN MY ONLY MISSION HERE IS TO REPENT FOR “MY” PAST CRIMES

BUT UNTIL THEN, i’M JUST IN PROCESS

JUST A ROLLING ROCK, GATHERING NO MOSSES

UNSURE OF THE DESTINATION

BUT SURE WHAT THE TICKET’S COST IS

WHILE i GOBBLE UP EVERYDAY LIKE A BOX OF UNMARKED CHOCOLATES

AND THOUGH MY TUMMY RUMBLES LIKE A BAD BRAINS MOSH PIT

Y’KNOW i STILL DO THAT SHIT AGAIN LIKE i DON’T KNOW WHAT THE POX IS

AND SO i GUESS THAT’S WHY THEY SAY

WHEREVER YOU GO, THERE YOU ARE

BUT WHEREVER i GO, i SOMEHOW FIND MYSELF THERE

AND Y’KNOW THEY SAY THE GRASS IS GREENER FROM AFAR

BUT, i KNOW THE GRASS IS GREENER WHERE THERE’S CARE

AND i KNOW THEY FEAR THE SPIDER’S GOT MY HEART

THE WAY i ALWAYS SAY “OH CONTRARE”

BUT IT'S ONLY ANANSI PLAYING PART

WHEN i SPEAK UP FOR WHAT'S RIGHT,

WHEN i SPEAK UP FOR WHAT'S FAIR

AND Y’KNOW NOW IT’S GETTING DOWN TO THE WIRE,

AND i STILL HAVEN’T FINISHED THIS PROJECT.

BUT i GUESS THAT’S JUST ME

TRAPPED IN THE WEB

A PERPETUAL WORK IN PROGRESS
