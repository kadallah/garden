HERE WE ARE STUCK BETWEEN THE SMOG AND A HOT PLACE, TWO STATES WE’VE COME TO KNOW AS ONE AND THE SAME; OR RATHER A SELF DEVOURING DRAGON OF GREED AND GLOOM, DANGER AMD DOOM, DISASTER AND ITS PREDECESSOR, FLIRTING ON THE EDGE OF THE TOMB.

OUR LUNGS ARE COATED WITH SOOT FROM THE SMOG OF OUR MOUNTS, THE FIRELESS SMOKE OF OUR SINNERLESS SINS, AND THE MECHANISMS WE PRESCRIBE OURSELVES TO COPE WITH SOIL AND SOULS ALMOST STATIC IN THEIR BLAZE.

THIS FIRE SEASON BEGINS WITH 10101 ACRES BUT QUICKLY CONSUMES SOON TO BE ALLIED NATION STATES AND IDEOLOGICAL CONGLOMERATES IN SYNCHRONOUS FLAME WARS THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN SEA BOARD BETWEEN MAN, NATURE AND NEW BREEDS OF NON BELIEVERS.

BUT WE THE PLEEBS MUST BARE THIS HEAT, SET PERMANENT SEATS BELOW THE A.C., SUCK AND GASP WITH LIPS AND ESOPHAGUY, GULP DOWN MOUTHFULS OF LUKE WARM ICE CUBES, LIFE FORCE SQUEEZED THROUGH CARCINOGENICALLY CONTAMINATED TUBES, A LONG DEAD DINOSAUR’S OILY, SEE-THROUGH TEET, INTO OUR PERMANENTLY COTTONED MOUTHS UNPARCHED IN THE NUDE, QUIET, RELATIVELY COOL NIGHT HOURS BEFORE AN ICE BOX DOOR THAT WOULD BEG TO BE SHUT IF IT LIVED BEHIND GRUFF PERSONALITIED SECURITY SYSTEMS PALLING AROUND WITH CENTRALIZED COOLING SPIRITS IN A REALITY WHERE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AS FREELY AS WATER, GAS, AND MORTGAGE PAYMENTS ON A SUMMER HOME SOMEPLACE WITH A VIEW OF THE OZONE.

“IT’S HOT” SPIKE SAYS THROUGH SAMUEL ON SIZZLING STREETS LONG BEFORE SNOWMAGGEDON 3: RETURN OF SNOWPOCALYPSE STOLE WINTERS FROM THE EAST BACK BETWEEN WHEN FACTORY FARMS FOUGHT AND SLAUGHTERED MOM AND POP, LOPPED OFF THEIR MOPS, AND SOLD THE MEAT AS ORGANIC TO COPS CONQUERING THE PRAIRIES ONE WALMART AT A TIME, AND OUR FINAL FRONTIER BECOMING LANDLOCKED BY A FRANCE SIZED MASS OF PASSPORTS AND CASH WITH WOULD BE DYNASTY BUSTERS APPEARING PENSIVE BEHIND WARNINGS OF DEATH AND DECAY BELOW A RED LIGHTHOUSE IN A GORILLA BAY.

THIS FIRE SEASON BEGAN BEFORE THE VECTORALISTS REIGN, BEFORE CAPITALISTS INVENTED RAIN, BEFORE THE PASTORALISTS CAME AND SET THE STAGE WITH COWS CAUGHT SECURE IN THEIR REIGNS AND THEY'VE SAID IT'LL NEVER END, THAT THIS IS THE END, THAT THE END DONE CAME AND WENT AND GONE AND ALL ALONG WE STAYED N-ALL THE WISER ON "MY LAND" WITH "MY WOMEN" BLESSED BY "MY GOD;" BUT BY GOD, MY GOD CLAIMS THAT FIRE SEASON BEGAN BEFORE LAND AND GOD AND MAYBE EVEN WOMAN TOO BUT ITS BEEN A WHILE AND THINGS GET BLURRY THAT FAR BACK.

BUT ITS HERE, ITS HOT AS THE BLOCK AND THIS WHOLE TOWN IS JUST A MIRAGE OASIS BETWEEN THE UNDERPASS BELOW THE HIGHWAY AND THE GOLF COURSE, BRIDGING THE NOMADIC SETTLERS OF SKID ROW TO THE ACTORS OF LOS FELIZ, ACTING LIKE THEY CARE BEHIND TRIPLE LAYERED MASKS AND LIES ABOUT NOT HAVING ANY CASH, AND JUST AS IN THE PAST THESE TOWERS OF BABYLON WILL CRASH LIKE A CAMEL LONG DEAD BEFORE IT DISCOVERS JUST WHICH STRAWS BROKE ITS BACK, BUT IN THE MEAN TIME, AS WE SLOWLY DIE FROM THIRST AND EXPOSURE IN A CIVILIZATION BY THE SEA, WHERE ACTIVISTS QUANTIFY CHANGE BY THE NUMBER OF RETWEETS, HOW DO WE DECIDE IF ITS OKAY TO TURN ON OUR A.C.S?---
