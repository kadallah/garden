ON THE LAND OF QUAOAR 
IN THE SHADE OF EASY KINDLING 
THERE’S A STRANGER IN AN OLD PLACE 
WITH A HISTORY EVER BEGINNING

BOOKS BURNING BY THE DOZEN 
NAMES REWRITTEN NOW REMITTED 
ADMITTED PEOPLE OF PESTLE 
SHOULD’VE NEVER BEEN COMMITTED 
TO MEMORIES THROUGH PEEP HOLES 
UNACCUSTOMED 
TO RIDGES FIRST RISEN 
WHILE HUMANITY WAS JUST GILLED FISHES 
AND THE POISON GAS IN THE AIR 
WAS STILL 
ALL NATURAL

PERSONALITY STAT STACKED FOR 
FLEXIBILITY 
CHAMELEON BORN OF BRAIN CHEMISTRY 
CHEMICALLY INDUCED EMOTIONAL ALCHEMY 
AND E.X.P. DEFINED BY GRINDING ADAPTABILITY

A SHADOW PERSON 
HIGH ON THEIR OWN SUPPLY 
OF ENDLESS VOID CONSUMING INSIDE 
VOICES DEVOID THE CHOICE OF 
AVOIDING CLOISTERS THIS CLOSE TO SHORE 
SURE IS LONELY ON THE ENDLESS ROAD IN SEARCH 
OF MORE

TRAPPED BY CIRCUMSTANCE IN A BOX 
MOSTLY FIGURATIVE 
FIGURES THIS FIGURE AFFIXED TO 
MEAN SPIRITED FIXES 
AND UNWRITTEN PRESCRIPTIONS 
UNWARRANTED CONNIPTIONS 
A NETWORK OF ADDICTIONS 
DEFINED NOT BY SUBSTANCE 
BUT SEEMINGLY REHEARSED REPE 
RE-PE 
REPE-TITIONS

A STUTTERING THOUGHT PROCESSING CONDITIONS 
THEY ARE INTERRUPTED 
BY THE EMPTINESS THEY SOUGHT 
IN EVERY PILL POPPED 
AND SHOOTER SHOT

AND NOW THAT IT IS HERE 
THEY FIGHT FIRE WITH GAS 
STARE AT GLASS FOR HOURS 
EYES SCOURING FOR CRACKS

SLIPS BACK INTO A REALITY 
UNWANTED WHEN IT ALREADY CAME TO PASS
BUT MAYBE THIS TIME IT WON’T GROW TIRESOME SO FAST 
MAYBE THIS ILLUSION WILL BE THE ONE THAT’LL LAST
AND THE GROWLING IN THEIR GUT WILL BE A THING OF THE PAST
“HA,” THE ENLIGHTENED ABOVE THE LAND LAUGH

ABUNDANCE ABOUND
CONVENIENCE CONSTRUCTED 
THIS TOWN A TOWER 
VISIBLE BY AIR, LAND, AND WATER 
NO GUARDIANS AFFIXED 
NO REWARD WITHOUT RISK 
NO PAIN WITHOUT GAIN
THE MANTRA INSISTS 
COMMODIFIED KAMA 
UNSANGHAFIED SUTRAS 
OVER MISTRANSLATED TANTRA 
AND GANG SIGNED MUDRAS

A SHADOW PERSON 
PARASITICALLY SAPS SUBSISTENCE 
FROM A HOST ONCE WHOLE 
ONCE HOLY, NOW WHOLEY HOLEY 
MADE BIGGER THROUGH SUBTRACTION 
A PARADOX WRAPPED IN ABSTRACT DISTRACTION

AS THE SHADOW SELF FEEDS 
THROUGH EGO AND WEED 
SURELY, THE FLESH GROWS 
GROWS ONLY WEAKER INDEED

A SPIRITED CORPSE
IN REAL TIME BROUGHT FORTH 
THE HIDDEN NOW OUTWEIGHS THE SEEKER
