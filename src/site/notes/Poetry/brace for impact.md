clenched anuses and tight fists
heads down, hands covering wrists

meditation bells sound somberly 
tolling for the souls whose lives have been sold 
for fake freedoms and funds 
ever stolen by the masterâ€™s son 
He who will never play the game 
but has already claimed to have won

and our hearts hear the hidden intercom 
hidden beyond open sky 
warning us to brace for impact 
for we have not yet earned our rights to die

and we long for the sweet release of flashing terror
lungs gasping through shock 
and the drench of our cold sweat 
to blink away the blur and not quite rest 
but remain assured
it was all a heat nightmare 
from too much constriction 
and socks unremoved 
but this reality is unrelenting 
and no matter how much we rage 
we are never allowed to disengage
