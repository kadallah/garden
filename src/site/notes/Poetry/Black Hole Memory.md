People talk about burn holes in their memories, dark spots erased by substance and smoke leaving behind nothing but soot and a lack of feeling where combustion made contact.

But what of black holes? Super massive, solar system shifting occurrences shrouded in mystery. Something incomprehensibly enormous, yet lacking all mass, talked about vaguely in scientific terms, but detached from any lived experience.

From where we stand, a memory of an event we know occurred and altered our fates forever, but that we may never see or fully comprehend. A space in our minds where morality bends like darkness and light, and screams of terror and joy are swallowed up, compressed into one, repressed into none, and disappeared. That is, except for the black holes left in our memories, daring to be explored.
