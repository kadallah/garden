down by the river
through the desert
out in the sea

I can't believe it
no, can't conceive it
the horror I've seen

pray I did dream it
just took a bad trip
imagined that horrid scene

that killed my brother
took my sister
dispossessed my siblings

drowned in the river
burned in the desert
gutted in the sea

---

down by the river
through the desert
out in the sea

red tide is rising
black bullets flying
backed by money green

leaving white so blinding
left the light behind
in search of greed
