WE LIVE ON A PLANET BORN OF BELIGERENT BLOODS 
DIP YOUR TOES IN THE CONFLICT 
WATCH YOU DIE IN THE FLOOD 
SCRUB EVE’S HANDS CLEAN, 
BUT NO RELEASE FROM ADAM’S CRUD 
AND AIN’T THAT THE CRUX 
WE LIVE IN A MYTH IN WHICH WE’RE NEVER ENOUGH 
TO ATONE FOR THE SINS OF PAST MOTHERS FUCKED 
FUTURE FATHERS PASSIVELY CUCKED 
WHILE LIVING IN THE MUD 
OF THREE PARTS MUCK, 
SEVEN PARTS BLOOD

SO LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU 
TO WAR WORLD 3 
HOME TO UNCIVILIZATIONS SEETHING FROM SEA TO STINKING SEA 
WITH TIK TOKING TOWERS FALLING LIKE CLOCKWORK ON REPEAT 
TO AMPHIBIOUS CREATURES SOON TO CONCEIVE OF 
WHITENED REEFS OUT OF REINFORCED CONCRETE 
REINFORCING THAT THERE CAN BE NO RETREAT 
WHEN ITS THE WORLD ITSELF THAT BRINGS THE LIVING TO THEIR KNEES 
SURE, BY PLAGUE AND FAMINE AND ENDEMIC DISEASE 
BUT REALLY BY A FOURTH FIGURE THAT COMMANDS THESE OTHERS WITH EASE

HE WHOSE NAME WE DARE NOT SPEAK 
HE WHOSE NAME WE’VE KEPT ON REPEAT SO LONG 
ITS LOST ALL MEANING 
HE WHO, NEVER ONE TO REMAIN THE SAME, 
MUTATES AT A RATE SO INHUMANE 
BETWEEN THE TIME WE OPEN OUR MOUTHS AND COMPLETE HIS NAME 
HE HAS SHIFTED SHAPE 
FOUND NOVEL WAYS TO INFLICT NEW PAIN

SO WHAT DO YOU CALL A ~~WAR~~ 
WHERE ONE SIDE KILLS BY THE THOUSANDS
BURIES AND BURNS CORPEREAL MOUNTAINS OF 
FLESHY FAMILIES AND TORTURED TODDLERS 
ONCE DOCTORS, LOVERS, BROTHERS, MOTHERS 
NOW VESTIGIAL VESSELS OF VISCERA 
WHILE “THE OTHER” TAKES REFUGE IN REFUSE
LIVE IN THE ONCE CONSECRATED, NOW DETONATED 
HIDE IN HOSPITALS, ONCE HEALING NOW HOLLOWED
BY THE WHOLEY UNHOLY 
FLEE TO FAR AWAY FOREIGN ESCAPES 
FEARFUL FLOCKS OF MILLIONS MET WITH DISDAIN
LABELLED A DRAIN
BARRED FAR FROM PLAIN SIGHT 
AS THOUGH THEIR PAIN MIGHT 
TRIGGER DOMESTIC CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE UNCIVIL SOCIETY’S 
COMPLACENCY 
IN “THE OTHER’S” PLIGHT

WHAT DO YOU CALL A ~~GENOCIDE~~ THAT DEFIES DEFINITION? 
NOT AN ETHNIC CLEANSING, 
BUT A MORE SINISTER MISSION 
DELIBERATE DEHUMANIZATION 
DELIVERED WITH THE UTMOST PRECISION 
A/B TESTING ATROCITIES 
TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFICIENT 
LISTEN 
YOU MAY JUST HEAR PISTOLS PUMPING PISTONS 
THE WAY OCCUPATION MAKES WAY FOR BIG BUSINESS 
YOU MAY JUST HEAR DICTIONARIES CHANGE SHAPE FOR THE RICHEST 
WHERE EVERYWHERE BUT COURT 
“THE OTHER” CAN ONLY BEAR WITNESS

WHEN PLANETARY SLAVERY 
TRANSLATES TO “REVOLUTION OF INDUSTRY” 
THE MAGIC OF SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT IS FINALLY REVEALED TO BE 
HAVING A CONTROLLED CONTROL GROUP THAT WORKS FOR FREE

ALL MONETARY ECONOMY RELIES ON THIS ALCHEMY 
AND THAT’S NO DIFFERENT HERE ON WAR WORLD 3 
WHERE COMMERCIALS ARE MADE OF CORPSES 
CUT INTO ADS FOR DRONES, DRUGS, AND DOMES RESISTANT TO THWARTING
THAT COME WITH FREE W.M.D.S AS THANKS FOR SUPPORTING 
AND A MONEY BACK GUARANTEE IF AFTER SETTLED DUST 
YOU STILL HEAR ADHAN THROUGH THE MOURNING

WHAT DO YOU CALL ~~~APARTHEID~~~ 
WITH SO MUCH MEANING PUSHED TO THE SIDE 
WHEN CASTE CASTS CASKETS FOR THOSE THIS SIDE OF THE LINE
AND THAT SIDE DOES MUCH MORE THAN SURVIVE 
FEEDING FROM THIS CAPTIVE CLASS 
NEEDING A ~~NIGGER~~ BY ANY NAME TO THRIVE 
WHERE THE PURPOSE OF THE DRONES FILLING THE SKY 
MAY SHIFT IN THEIR MEANING FROM DAY INTO NIGHT
IN THE MORNING SURVEILLING NATIVE LANDS TO DETERMINE THE RIGHT PRICE 
AFTERNOON SPENT TRAILING “OTHERS” WITH THE WRONG FAMILY TIES 
EVENING COMES, “THE OTHER” PREPARES FOR BED, 
ANOTHER PREPARES THE FRONT LINE

THE NIGHT STRIKES AS WHITE KNIGHTS STREAK NIGHT SKIES WITH WHITE LINES AND OUTCRIES

BY DAWN, WE'VE REDEFINED THE MEANING OF “RED LINES”

AS AMAZON CALCULATES THE WAIT FOR THIS STREET TO BE RENAMED, 
(Y’KNOW THIS REAL ESTATE'S PRIME)
ON THE NEWS, WON’T CONCEDE TO EVEN CALL IT GENTRIFIED 
AS BLOOD FILLS THE STREETS GERRYMANDER RHYMES WITH 
GENOCIDE

SO WE TURN TO THE TONGUE OF “OTHERS” 
TO TEASE OUT NEW TERMS 
BUT EVEN ~~~NAKBA~~~ IS TOO SMALL, 
TOO DEFINITIVE A WORD 
WHEN HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF AND MAGNIFIES WITH EACH RETURN 
THE SUM OF FINITE TRAGEDIES IS NOT EQUAL TO 
SUCH 
SLOW 
PURGE 

INDIVIDUAL INCANTATIONS COMBINE 
IN AN EVER MORE ENCOMPASSING SCOURGE 
YET WE MUST NEVER CROSS THE LINE 
AND DEFINE THESE CRIMES AS CURSE 
FOR IT IS MAN WHO CALLS KILLING CLEANSING 
WHO PILLAGES TO PROVE HIS OWN WORTH 
WHO MUST WATCH EVERY BOOK GO UP IN FLAMES
BEFORE HE SIFTS THROUGH THE ASHES TO LEARN

---

NOW, MAY I REMIND YOU 
THIS IS YOUR PLANET ON DISPLAY 
THIS MAZE SURROUNDS YOU
NOT SOME WORLD IN FAR AWAY SPACE
SO I ASK 
WHAT'S THE ROUTINE FOR STARTING OUR DAYS? 
NOTHING BUT THUMBING HEARTS OF DEATH AND DECAY 
SHARING DEAD CHILDREN CHARRED BLACK IN THE BLAZE 
WHILE STATING OUR POSITIONS 
THROUGH THE NEWEST DANCE CRAZE

WHAT’S THE CURE FOR THIS ENDLESS MALAISE? 
BESIDES SIPPING SOME SOMA TO DEAL WITH THE PAIN 
WHY, TAPPING OUR SCREENS TO SWITCH BETWEEN MEMES 
DEAD BODIES IN THE STREETS 
AND LSD EMULATED DREAMS

CROTCHED A NEW JERSEY
TO REP MY NEW TEAM 
EVIDENCED BY THE NEW EMOJI 
IN MY NEW PROFILE
THIS NEW WEEK

AND YOU KNOW 
WE PAID WITH ATTENTION 
BUT WE PAID ALL THE SAME 
CAUSE WE ARE WHAT WE EAT 
NO MATTER THE TASTE 
AND WE FEED FROM OUR FEEDS 
THOUGH WE SHIT IN THAT PLACE

AND HOW QUICKLY WE’VE FORGOTTEN 
REICHS ONE AND TWO 
HOW HITLER LEARNED FROM WHO 
A NOT QUITE NEO-NAZI 
THAT STILL AIN’T FLOWN THE COOP 
THAT BALFOUR CAME BEFORE THE FUHRER FUROR WAS BORN 
WHAT 1884 SWORE BUT THE BILTMORE BUILT MORE FOR 
HOW QUICKLY WE’VE FORGOTTEN 
WHAT STRANGE FRUITS COME FROM STRANGE ROOTS

---

NOW, ME SAY THE WAR IS IN OUR HANDS 
FEEL IT IN OUR SCREENS 
IN THE TANTALUM, THE TIN, AND THE TUNGSTEN GOLD MEMES

WE SAY THE WAR IS IN OUR HANDS 
AND WE CAN'T GRASP PEACE 
THROUGH THE BLOOD IN ROOT ADMIN
THE BLOOD IN OUR STREAMS
