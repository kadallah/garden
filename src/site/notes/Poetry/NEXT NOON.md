PROMISES OF 40 ACRES, FEMME MULES

AND A HOT PINK DROP TOP

DRIBBLE DOWN HIS CHIN IN STUTTERS AND

UNFINISHED SENTENCES

(incoherent)

HE WOOS

COERCES CONSENT

COURTS ACCOMPLICES

WITH SLIGHTEST OF HAND

AND AN INVOLUNTARY WINK

TRANSFORMS COMPLACENCY

INTO COMPLICITY

AND IN THE OTHER CORNER

AN EGO LARGE ENOUGH TO OCCUPY ALL FOUR

IN EACH HE SITS ATOP A HORSE

WHITE ENTERED THE ARENA FIRST

PALE GALLOPING IN CIRCLES SCREAMS

SO LOUD THEY RESEMBLE SILENCE

BLACK HAS MADE A GRAND ENTRANCE WITH PONIES IN TOW

WHILE RED PLOTS UNWONTEDLY SILENT

---

REHEARSED SMILES AND DEBUNKED DENIALS MAKE

OUR HEARTS TIC FASTER AND

KEEP OUR CLOCK BEATS SLOW

MEMORIES OF POST BLACK OUT HOLES IN MEMORIES

AND BLOODIED GARMENTS THIS MORNING CLEAR AS SNOW

LEFT WITH SWEATY HANDS AND A BALL THEY CLAIM WE DROPPED

AS PUNISHMENT WE ARE LEFT WITH THE CHOICE...

---

AND SHE IS THE SAVIOR PROMISED

ALL THOSE CENTURIES AGO

ONLY MINUTES TOO LATE

FOR THEY’VE JUST CLOSED THE SHOW

THEY CALL HER CRITICS HATERS

MADE OF WHITE OUT AND RAGE

BUT THEY SCREAM NOT OF BLACKNESS

ON THE BACK SIDES OF HER HANDS

BUT BLOOD STAINED PALMS

AND UNCONSIDERED DEMANDS

DESPITE THROATS RAW FROM

THE ASTROPHYSICS OF AFRO LIBERATION

THEY MUSTER THE ENERGY

FOR AN UNREQUESTED EXPLANATION

  

SHE.

IS.

THE MAN.

  

THE TONE ISN’T FELT THROUGH

TEXT AND TWEET

AND UNIRONIC FEIGNED IGNORANCE

BECOMES 4 YEARS OF MEMES

AN EGO INFLATED BY ABUSING THE SYSTEM VS

HE WHO BOASTS OF BIRTHING IT

ALONG WITH THEIR LESS CELEBRATED

MORE VISIBLE

"SUPER PREDATOR"
